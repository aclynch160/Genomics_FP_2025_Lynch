Hello! This is a repository for the code used for my final class project, "comparative genome analysis of CD8 T cell populations between species". 

If you have found yourself here: please use or adapt this code as you see fit, if you find any use for it! 

The optimization took a while, but this is a fairly quick pipeline to download, index, annotate, and analyze a full-length Eukaryotic genome (or five). 
It also allows for merging of datasets already analyzed and trusted, such as those from highly reputale sources like the ImmGen genome browser. 

Do note that for more complex purposes, the subread module may be more effective for mapping and read counting than the default STAR settings.
